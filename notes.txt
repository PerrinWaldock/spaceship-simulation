Plan:
-objects
	-spaceship
	-planets/sun
	-asteroids
	-all interact gravitationally on eachother

-controls
	-initial
		-change masses of various planets
	-ongoing
		-0 to 9 to adjust escape thrust
		-arrow keys to control rotation (no energy)

-animation
	-show trail, length/color depending on how powerfully rocket is thrusting?

-extras
	-? fire projectiles at asteriods (with full momentum); inelastic collision (space bar)
	-? each object has "health" which is reduced by kinetic energy of two objects hitting eachother. Randomly split target in half; maintain momentum
